### Task 1: 
Write a basic neural network library and implement it on classification for the ```iris``` dataset.

Loss functions can be MSE or Cross Entropy whilst activation functions can be ReLU or Sigmoid.

```python nn_lib.py```

### Task 2: 
Use the neural network library on a regression task to predict the cartesian co-ordinate of a robot arm.

```python learn_FM.py```

### Task 3: 
Use the neural network library on a classification task to predict the location of a robot arm out of 4 possible regions of interest (ROIs).

```python learn_ROI.py```
